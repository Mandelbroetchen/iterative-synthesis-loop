# Freefall of an Apple - Physics Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the freefall motion of an apple under Earth's gravity, demonstrating fundamental physics principles including Newton's laws of motion and kinematic equations.

## Core Concepts
- **Freefall**: Motion where gravity is the only force acting on an object
- **Gravity**: Constant acceleration of 9.81 m/s² near Earth's surface
- **Kinematics**: Study of motion without considering forces

## Key Features
1. Real-time position, velocity, and acceleration tracking
2. Time-based simulation with configurable parameters
3. Visual representation of the falling apple
4. Data export for analysis

## Mathematical Model
The simulation uses these kinematic equations:
- Position: y(t) = y₀ + v₀t + ½gt²
- Velocity: v(t) = v₀ + gt
- Acceleration: a = g (constant)

Where:
- y₀ = initial height
- v₀ = initial velocity
- g = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- t = time
